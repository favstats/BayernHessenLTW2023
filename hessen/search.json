    "text": "Methodology\nIn collaboration with Who Targets Me, we monitored 584 political advertisers in Hessen during the 2023 Hessen Landtwagswahl to better understand how campaigns use different targeting methods made available by Meta. To do this, we used data from the Meta Ad Library, using the new ‘Audience’ data which gives some detail on how pages target their ads.\nTo better understand the election, we kept only advertisers who:\n\nAdvertised in the last 7 days (Sep 13th - Sep 19th 2023)\nAdvertised in the last 30 days (Aug 21st - Sep 19th 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMeta only provides 7, 30 and 90 days windows for the targeting data in their Ad Library. Meta’s data also lags by a few days. Report will be updated as soon as new data is available.\n\n\nFor Google platforms, data accessed via the Google Transparency Report provides spending on how much money was spent by parties. In order to fit the Meta ranges, we also show the last seven and 30 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThe data shown in this dashboard is based on the platform’s respective ad libraries which are known to be sometimes incomplete (Edelson et al. 2020; Silva et al. 2020). For this reason the data shown here might not reflect the full picture nor all political ads that were targeted at voters.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Creator of the Dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabio Votta is a Postdoc at the University of Amsterdam who studies (online) political microtargeting and its usage around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to see how political parties target you?
